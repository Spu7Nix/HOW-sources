# HOW-sources
The source scripts and blender files for my level HOW

#Files that are missing:

- Blender project for the splashing HOW logo (couldn't find)
- Two python files for exporting and importing level strings to gd (I dont wanna cause another image-to-gd disaster)
- Very tiny scripts that were used for convinience but were overwritten
